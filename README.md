███▌                                                                     ▐███
███▌        1. Nothing to install here, the source is rather ugly,for    ▐███
███▌           compilation you need the NTL library (www.shoup.net/ntl)  ▐███
███▌           It would be nicer to directly use the inverted matrices   ▐███
███▌           but it's not necessary                                    ▐███
███▌        2. It should be rather simple to adapt it to whatever        ▐███
███▌           compiler you use, that's why we didn't supply             ▐███
███▌           library and project files, but only main.cpp + header     ▐███
